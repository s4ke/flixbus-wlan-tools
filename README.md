# flixbus-wlan-tools

This repository contains tools to connect to the wlan in Flixbus's fleet while still being able to surf any webpage you want. Tools for infinite WLAN usage are available as well.

Note #1: These tools are for educational usage only as the usage is against the Terms and Conditions of  the Flixbus WLAN. If you use this, you are reliable for any damage this software might have caused.

Note #2: I didn't develop the macspoofer or devmanview so these obviously don't fall under the MIT license, but I still am not responsible for any damage these might have caused, nor are the respective developers of these tools.
